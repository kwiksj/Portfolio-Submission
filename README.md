Grocery Tracking Reflection


Summarize the project and what problem it was solving:

I made a program that counts how many times people bought each grocery item. It helps the store figure out a better way to set up their produce.



What did you do particularly well?

I made the program easy to use, and I set it up so it saves a backup file without anyone having to do anything.



Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I could add better checks to make sure people don’t break it by typing random stuff. It would make it run smoother and not crash.



Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

Figuring out the map part was kinda hard at first. I looked at zyBooks and online examples until it made sense. I’m saving more cheat sheets and videos to help next time.



What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or coursework?

Reading files, using classes, and organizing data will help in pretty much any coding project.



How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I used simple names, added a bunch of comments, and kept the code neat so it’s easy to update later.
